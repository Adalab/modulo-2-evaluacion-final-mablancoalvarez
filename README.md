# Cool TV SHOW :movie_camera::mag_right:

functionalities

1.This project we are asked to make a call to an API (http://api.tvmaze.com/), where we can get data from all available TV series. 
2.After getting all the series stored, we can search for the one we want and add it to a list of favorites. 
3.Selecting the one we want and adding it will also change the background color.
4.We will save each of these movies in Local Storage so we can keep watching them without refreshing the page.
5.Finally we can remove the movie we want from our favorites list.


## Requirements

Pre-install Node.js and Gulp

Steps to follow:
Clone the repository on your computer.
Enter in your terminal the command npm install to install the Gulp dependencies.


## Tools.  used:   hammer:


The first step has been to use the Adalab Web Starter Kit tool through which we automated many of the tasks. For example having a server permanently connected to be able to visualize the changes. For this we installed node.
This tool is executed through NPM install and started through NPM start .
I have also used HTML5 , CS3 , Saas and Javascript technology.
